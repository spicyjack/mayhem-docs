## Mayhem Todos ##
- "Ye Olde Doom Shoppe" - YODS
  - Wad browser and search engine
  - There's a script (in idgas-tools.git) to sum the size of the text files,
    maybe they can all be included in the app/webapp
  - How to catalog search terms?
  - How to present searches to the user?  Lists of terms to search for?
  - wad2svg - Convert WAD maps to SVG for displaying on the screen
    - http://doombsp.sourceforge.net/wad2svg/
  - wad2pdf - Convert WAD maps to PDF
    - http://wad2pdf.sourceforge.net/
- idGames Archive
  - Public API - http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/api/
- Create "Common" role; requires docs, config block header attribs
- Move contents of Chocolate build() method to Vanilla Doom module
- Create a WAD role; Mayhem::Data::DoomWad
- Finish the new View socket thread object 
  - set up the socket to the Controller
  - call the SplashScreen object
    - View passes itself into the SplashScreen object so that the SplashScreen
      can send the View socket messages
    - Splashscreen registers which actions (method calls) it can perform with
      the View object
    - remove anything having to do with sockets from the SplashScreen object
  - call the MainMenu object
    - View passes itself into the MainMenu object so that the SplashScreen can
      send the View socket messages
    - Splashscreen registers which actions (method calls) it can perform with
      the View object
    - remove anything having to do with sockets from the SplashScreen object
- How to migrate to Gtk3?
  - Maybe check for Gtk3 in a `BEGIN` block, and fall back to Gtk2 if Gtk3 is
    not available

## Release Todos ##
- Update copyrights in source files
- update version numbers
- Use `App::FatPacker` to build packed archives

### Testing ###
- Describe what messages the object will send and receive in the docs (above),
  then write tests that exercise the messages described in the docs
- Try to compare a downloaded ls-laR.gz file when the ls-laR.gz file doesn't
  exist on the local filesystem; the downloaded copy should become the local
  copy, and the rest of the files should be downloaded based on the ls-laR.gz
  file
- Test untainting $ENV{TEMP} (L1726)
- Test the script on Windows, test filepaths, and see what breaks (L1735)
## Mayhem API Protocol ##
- Sender sends a message
- Receiver acknowledges the message with 'OK' and the original sender's
  verb/action word if the receiver can handle the message; otherwise, responds
  with 'ERR' and original sender's verb/action word

## Portaboom/Mayhem Module Hierarchy ##
- App::Portaboom::[Setup|Config|Networking|Server] - Portaboom things
- App::Mayhem::Game::[Doom|Quake|Duke3D] - metadata about the games themselves
- App::Mayhem::Data::[Doom|Quake|Duke3D] - game data for that game
- App::Mayhem::Engine::[Chocolate|Doomsday|Eternity|etc.] - a specific game
  engine that implements one or more App::Mayhem::Game::* objects; example,
  ChocolateDoom can run Doom, Heretic/Hexen and Strife
- App::Mayhem::Utils::[WAD|etc.] - manage/modify game files; example,
  rearrange Doom WAD files so that a specific order of individual levels can
  be played

## Mayhem Ideas ##
- !MacMayhem, a Cocoa version
  - Quake 3 Xcode project: http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php
  - Platypus installer (θttp://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) plus GTK?
- Replace plaintext mayhem IPC messages with JSON/XML?  Change the IPC message
  system so you can swap out the message encoding
- WAD database
  - WADZilla, the WAD browser (database front end)
  - master database (comes with portaboom, generated by parsing out idgames
    mirror and possibly doomworld database)
    - iwads
    - idgames pwads
  - user database
    - preferences
    - copied back to storage
  - Use blocks of transactions to make the database easy to replicate
    - Use one month blocks for the transaction size; each month a new
      transaction block is created, and can be downloaded by clients that want
      to use it
- version watcher (in lack's code tree)
- Change GTK themes/color schemes on the fly?
- Profile memory usage
  - memory usage prior to lazy_use
  - memory usage after lazy_use
- Status update tool
  - For every task, ask the user when to complete that task, record the
    settings in the config file
    - "Check for updates" - always, never, ask
    - "Check for new /idgames uploads?" - always, never, ask
    - "Check for Portaboom peers?" - always, never, ask
    - "Obtain IP address via DHCP?" - always, never, ask
- Conversion tool, convers normal WAD files into UDMF WAD files
- How to detect NVidia drivers in Portaboom?

### Docs ###
- Embed the call flows as Google Code friendly wiki syntax for Mayhem API
  calls into the Mayhem POD
- POD parser for embedded Markdown docs
