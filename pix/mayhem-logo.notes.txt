Creating the text logo with gimp
- create a large blank image with a black background (3000x650 or so)
- create a text object, with the correct font; you'll have to try different
  sizes until you get one that fits the window.  Make sure to leave some
  space around the edges for any logo graphics that are applied in the next
  step
- Right click on the text, choose Filter -> Alpha to Logo, then choose a
  filter to apply to your text
- if you get stuck, Ctrl-Z to undo your last change; keep trying different
  logos until you get one you're happy with
